#usage
#clear
Using HELPME is very easy.
Each project that has a "HELPME" file in it, already has a help sequence!
To use, simple navigate to your project folder using your terminal,
and type `helpme`; that's it! The help sequence will start right away!

At anytime, you could type `helpme -h` to see this screen.

#creation
#clear
In order to provide HELPME assistance to your users, you will need to create a new text file,
and save it under the name "HELPME" inside your project folder.

Every line you will type inside, will be outputed to the user, once he/she wrote `helpme` in the terminal.
Beside displaying plain text, HELPME provides few tokens:
#..
#clear
Location indicator
====================
A location indicator looks like this "#my_location" and describes what is the text under it is about.
#..
#clear
Jump indicator
====================
A jump indicator looks like this: "#>my_location",
and when HELPME reads that line, instead of printing it, it will jump to
the location specified by the location indicator (in this example, a location named "my_location")

for example:
    hello
    #>say_world
    foo bar
    #say_world
    world

will output:
    hello
    world
#..
#clear
Question indicator
====================
Asks the user for input, and jumps to a location according to the answer

for example:
    What do you want to eat, an apple or an orange?
    #? apple:apples, orange:oranges
    #apples
    You like apples!

    #oranges
    You like oranges!

This will output:
    What do you want to eat, an apple or an orange?
    [apple, orange]   <-- at this point the user will type 'orange'
    You like oranges!
#..
#clear
Clear indicator
====================
Looks like this: "#clear" and it clears the screen!

for example:
    hello
    #clear
    world

when done, user will see only:
    world
#..
#clear
Enter indicator
====================
An enter indicator requires the user to hit "Enter" before it continues.

for example:
    hello
    #..
    world

will output:
    hello
    [ENTER]

and only when the user will hit enter, it will write "world"
#..
#clear
That's it! it is all you need to know about HELPME!
